                    <span><h1>Why Us</h1>
                    <p>We have simplified and are still trying to simplify the player walkthrough experience even more, we also focus on providing clarity and direction to the player, specially the new ones, I really suggest visiting the <a href="#FAQ" target="_blank">FAQ</a> Section, it is found on the top left of the screen, the middle button!</p>
                    <p>We are very open to feedback, even the complaints and negative ones! We also simplified the feedback experience, not just to tell us, but even if you are facing any technical issues, we got multiple staffs prepared to assist any lost players, also in the time of the event, there will be staff to assist with any issues preventing you to join!</p>
                    <p>We also try to bring the creative and inspirational ideas to life, as we have and are growing on developer, builder, plug-in, artist, and montage teams (not all teams are in place now, as we are new and still growing, soon enough those teams and much more will be there!) who continue to work hard to make creative dreams a reality!</p></span>

                        <h1>What We Are Trying To Do</h1>
                        <p>We aspire to make a difference in the Minecraft community, bring creativity and imagination back (revive them), by gathering the creative and innovative minds together, and not just bring creativity and imagination back, but also beat the newfound toxicity in the community, we aim to be the top and best event organization ever, and leave a longlasting legacy to always be remembered by the minecraft community!</p>
                        <p>We are trying to start a new era in the minecraft timeline, one were minecraft's simplicity, creativity, innovation, imagination, and inspiration was the strongest pillar, and we not just do that for legacy, but to even help people from a far, express themselves, and let their imagination roam around freely, with no limitation, no restrictions (except for the rules stated), and no judgement, so are you ready to feel like a kid again?</p>
                        <p>We are not the kind that lives in the past trying to re-live the moment by bringing back minecraft's previous glory, but it had the best return and impact on my life and countless others, having a place were you can always express yourself, be creative, innovative, and imagine things, hang out with people, whether it is building, thriving, exploring, adventouring, learning new things, they are all already there! And with the help of mods and add-ons, we can diversify the player experience</p>

                        <h2>"Where Creativity and Innovation ensues!"</h2>
                        <p>(in conclusion) The Sanctuary (minecraft events), is a place were all the creative, and innovative minds come together to express their imagination, release stress, and have fun! we bring back the enthuiasm that is buried deep withing us, from long ago, since our childhood! </p>
                        <p>We aspire to re-ignite the flame of enthusiasm inside everyone! Minecraft is currently the most suitable place for us to make that dream come true! There, you can strive as far as you want, explore, build, adventure, learn, try, draw, do, and much much more! The limits are endless, there is literally everything!</p>
                        <P>What we do over that is also provide a friendly community, were you are never judged, not treated badly, and most of all, no toxicity, as there is a lot of toxicity in the minecraft communiuty, we firmly believe we can make a change in the minecraft community, and start a new era, so we try our best to make that happen, and i know at some point, it will happen!</P>

                        <h1><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upload system</span> (for you)</h1>
                        <p>I wont talk about the upload schedule here, but i will talk about the upload system from your point of view, once you finished a civilization event of ours, edited and documented it, you cannot upload the video on any platform or publicly until the main event document video is uploaded on the main channel.</p>
                        <p>You cannot share your recorded video with anyone online as they can leak clips from it and that will end up putting you in trouble (there will be investigations and you will get caught), so keep it to yourself, and work on editing it if you want, until the main video is uploaded on the main channel. Thank you!</p>
                        <p>This is done to not kill the hype, and keep in mind that the main video will take its fair share of time before it is uploaded as the montage team will give it their best!</p>

                        <p>We focus most on civilization events as they bring the most out of everyone, with everything evolving, players making friends, teams, alliances, and ofcourse in-game enemies!</p>
                        <p>Civilization events were no rules are set, makes players choose their purpose, they can do literally anything! So the possibilities are literally endless! Combine that with having multiple players, and you get a lot of really cool stuff!</p>
                        <p>Soon enough, we will even add custom maps, builds, mobs, weapons, and much more to enhance the player experience, in all fields, adventure, exploration, discovery, and much much more, all made possible with the help of mods and plug-ins!</p>

                        <p style="padding-right: 4%;"><li>The staff ranking system is a set of ranks for the staff, that helps staying organized, easy accessibility, job positioning, and as a connected web in conclusion, the ranks and their jobs are as follow:</li></p>
                        <p style="padding-right: 4%;"><li>First and top rank is the manager rank, and their job is to manage everything and make sure they are going fine, find and solve problems, try to grow the whole business, and is/are considered to be the entrepreneur(s) of the business.</li></p>
                        <p style="padding-right: 4%;"><li>Second rank is Executive, the Executive rank is like a mini version of the manager, as the manager treats everything like a business and has an eye out for everything, an executive treats his section like a business, and keeps an eye out for everything in it, staying innovative, creating new things, organizing, arranging, etc. The executive rank is holding a section of the entire organization. </li></p>
                        <p style="padding-right: 4%;"><li>third rank is the staff member, and staff member rank can be a part of a staff section which includes multiple staff members, and executives have multiple staff sections they manage, thus multiple staff members working under their wings. </li></p>
                        <p style="padding-right: 4%;"><li>for example of the whole thing, if there is a server executive responsible for the discord, then that executive works on improving the channels, accessibility, etc. That person also has staff members working under his wing like moderators, moderating the discord, in-server partnership staff members who talk with players inside the server who would like to discuss partnership and sponsorship deals, etc.</li></p>
                        <p style="padding-right: 4%;"><li>Keep in mind there is much more to it, but that is a brief explanation for new recruits, as you start getting promoted, you will get to know more about everything, and will attend team meetings, etc.</li></p>
                        <p><li>Requirements to join the staff team, and potentially getting paid too, are explained in conclusion in <a href="#FAQ" target="_blank">FAQ</a></li></p>
                        <p><li>You can start at a small position, and maybe even least rank in the entire system, but if you keep improving and growing, slowly and steadily you will be getting promoted until you reach the monetization zone and you can start earning!</li></p>

                            We have minors in the server who may not want to hear excessive swearing. Please use your common sense for this but feel free to ask a staff member if something is appropriate to say.
                            <br><br>
                            <li><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: large;">4. Do not participate in or begin raiding or spamming.</span></li><br>

                <h3>When do we host our events?</h3>

                <h3>How long do we play an event for?</h3>
                <p>As of how it is settled now, the event takes place for a week and a few days, with a 2 hour play time daily, we also sometimes host events on Saturday and Sunday with a 3-4 hours game time!</p>
                
                <h3>What are the requirements for me to join an event?</h3>
                <p>For our current stage, no strict requirements are needed, just confirm you will attend, and that will be it!</p>
                
                <h3>Are there any strict rules that limit my accessibility in-game?</h3>
                <p>There are no such rules that strict player acessibility, however, there are the standard ones like no hacking, cheating, bullying, etc (all rules listed in "<a href="#WWR" target="_blank">What We Are</a>")</p>
                
                <h3>Are there any mods I need to install to join, or any specific version?</h3>
                <p>At our current stage, no, any version, and any launcher except the hacked ones, but as we start adding custom specifications, we will use specific mods and version. I will update it here and in "<a href="#WWR" target="_blank">What We Are</a>" when that happens!</p>

                <h3>Do you guys follow a script to make content?</h3>
                <p>We do not follow a script, all players are allowed to do whatever they want freely, with no limitations!</p>

                <h3>How do I join the discord?</h3>
                <p>Click on the button on the top right of the screen with a discord icon, or this link: "<a href="https://discord.gg/EyrmWbnjPd" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/EyrmWbnjPd"</a></p>
                
                <h3>What if I face community issues, like bullying?</h3>
                <p>There are staff members who moniter the discord server, if they notice such behaviour from anyone, there will be punishment. However, if not noticed, you can report that incident, whether creating a discord ticket and talking with the staff, or calling (pinging) a local staff member. However, in any case, please have any proof (screenshot of the chat) or any witnesses.</p>
                
                <h3>What if the event time comes around and I have trouble joining?</h3>
                <p>There is a handful of staff members dedicated for that situation, who sit back in the discord and help players who face difficulty joining.</p>
                
                <h3>How do I pinch my ideas to the organization?</h3>
                <p>There is a section in the support in discord were you can make a ticket to share your ideas, and we will be glad to hear them out!</p>

                
                <h3>How do I share feedback?</h3>
                <p>There is a section in the support in discord were you can make a ticket to share your experience, with all pros and cons, and feedback is very much apreciated!</p>
                
                
                <h3>Can I record and upload on Youtube or any social platforms my experience?</h3>
                <p>All experiences cannot be shared anywhere unless the main video of the events is uploaded on the main channel first, all footage recorded during the event would be very apreciated if shared with the staff members so the montage and editing teams have a good foundation of muplitple prespectives to show, to improve our storytelling, and concluding the documentary of the entire event,</p>
                
                
                <h3>How can I share my drawings with everyone?</h3>
                <p>There is a section in discord, called Fan-arts, you can share your drawings there!</p>
                
                
                <h2>How do I apply to be a staff member?</h2>
                <p>First off, you have to be trusted, and by this I mean you need to atleast be two-weeks of activity in server, that atleast 2 of the discord moderators notice your presence, second off and more importantly, have a really valuable skillset that can help us, then there will be a section for applying as staff, you will share your skills that can uplift and make a difference, also be considerate that there is competition, and you are not the only person who thought of that role, so you will need to have an edge over anybody else, and in that ticket, describe more about what you want, like what position are you aiming to, etc, also tell us more about yourself, age, where from, hobbies, etc. Your application will be reviewed as soon as possible, and if it is not good enough, you will be informed and the ticket will be closed, if it is good enough, you will have to be interviewed by some high ranking officials, and asked some advanced questions, and if you passed, you will be informed what section you will hold!</p>
                
                
                <h3>Do staff members get paid?</h3>
                <p>Staff members get paid, but there are certain conditions, as of our begining, only executives (which are the second best rank in the whole staff ranking) will start getting paid, but conditions for them is like conditions for any other.</p>
                <p>Disclaimer: Keep in mind that the majority can contribute without getting paid, you can get promoted until you reach monetization zone, and start earning, but for that to happen, you need to be continously learning, growing, and improving, also, time will prove your loyalty and consistency, factors like these will decide your promotion till monetization so you start getting paid, so keep in mind that the majority are possibly not getting paid! So have a growth mindset to stay ahead and possibly get paid!</p>
                
                
                <h3>What are these conditions to get paid?</h3>
                <p>First off, you need to be so valuable that you are irreplacable at the moment, Second off, you need to continously keep learning, improving and growing, learning from experience (mistakes) and never stopping, Third off, and lastly, you have to treat your part as a business, be innovative and creative, make new things, and dont stop working on improving that area, that is more direct with executives as they hold certain areas, however, staff members can do most of them, but these requirements could possibly be excluded for the staff members</p>
                
                
                <h3>What is the staff ranking system, what are the ranks, and what do they do?</h3>
                <p>Summary answer in <a href="#WWR" target="_blank">What We Are</a></p>

                <p>Through our tickets! They are explained in "<a href="#Support" target="_blank">Support</a>" and are found in the discord!</p>

                
                <h3>If I join and am very overwhelmed by everything, and all I want is to just join a civilization event, what do I do?</h3>
                <p>First off as you join the discord server, read the rules, either from the discord or here in "<a href="#WWR" target="_blank">What We Are</a>, then head to "event-announcements" channel on the discord, then see the latest message, it will be an event announcement, check if it is still available or not, if it is still available, follow the requirements under the message to apply, and hopefully you will be picked, chosen ones will have access to the event's channels, and will by notified at a certain time, if the application time ended, then wait for the next announcement, in the meantime, you can chat with other people who share your passion in chat channels like general, media, etc!</p>
                
                <h3>Do we do twitch streams, and on what servers?</h3>
                <p>We certainly do! We do them on servers we partnered with, or other specific ones</p>
                
                <h3>What are the advantages of being a Twitch Subscriber, Youtube Member, or Nitro Booster?</h3>
